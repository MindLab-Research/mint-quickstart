# Embodied Demos

> **Status: Coming Soon** (Milestone M3)

One embodied agent demo is planned for this track.

## Planned Demos

### Embodied-1: Simulator Agent

- **Scope:** simplified simulator / gridworld / tool-based environment → action sequence with task success metric
- **Planned script:** `embodied_nav.py`
- **Planned deliverables:** runnable adapter using `rl_core.py`, minimal simulator, success metric

## Unblock Conditions

- RL track (M1) and VLM track (M2) stable
- Lightweight simulator environment selected (gridworld or tool-based)
- Environment reward interface defined

## Prerequisites (Expected)

- MinT SDK
- A lightweight simulator environment (TBD)
- `MINT_API_KEY`

## Timeline

This demo represents the capstone of the mint-quickstart learning path: **RL (reasoning) → VLM (perception) → Embodied (action)**.
